# Setup

Before running the project, let's make sure you are all set up properly. You will need:

1. A code editor. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though you can use whatever you're comfortable with.
2. A command line. I work on Mac OS/Linux, and I recommend [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you're on Windows because it will allow you to use Linux commands. That said, you can use native Windows if you choose, you may just have to convert some commands on your own.
3. [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
4. You shouldn't need to install any dependencies for this, the graphical [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) package we'll be using comes bundled with Python 3.

## What the project looks like

We'll be building this awesome maze generator and solver! By the end, your code will be rendering mazes like this one:
